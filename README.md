24/7 voice help for the homeless on Oahu

#### Try it: [on Vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai?demo=true&shareKey=4922b20f-1964-400c-ac08-21b6889bf23d&assistantId=10dfbbc9-5aef-41a2-ba43-4e62980412a6) or [jsalsman.github.io/ponoconnect](https://jsalsman.github.io/ponoconnect)

#### If both of those are unresponsive, it's probably because the billing limits are exceeded. You can create a free trial account on [dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/) and copy the settings below into "Create Assistant" / "Blank Template":

The First Message is: Greetings, this is the Oahu emergency housing locator. How may I help you?

The System Prompt is in [system-prompt.txt](system-prompt.txt) which uses several a one- and two-shot examples.
